# pet_shop_eth_tutorial

I want to show the petshop demo app for ethereum, it is too easy for the beginners :ok_hand:

:one: To initialize the project, you need to install the required node_modules, please type `npm install` in termainal of your project folder.

`npm install`

:bangbang: If there is any errors or issues, you can type `npm audit fix` to assure the security issues.

`npm audit fix`

:two: To run the app, you need to type `npm run dev` but here we use `dev` because this app is still in development state.

`npm run dev`

**your first dapp is now opened.** :100:
