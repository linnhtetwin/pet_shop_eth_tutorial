# pet_shop_eth_tutorial

I want to show the petshop demo app for ethereum, it is too easy for the beginners :ok_hand:

The official demo app can be found at [PetShop by Truffle Box](https://github.com/truffle-box/pet-shop-box)

:one: To initialize the project, you need to install the required node_modules, please type `npm install` in termainal of your project folder.
```
npm install
```
:no_entry: If there is any errors or issues, you can type `npm audit fix` to assure the security issues.
```
npm audit fix
```
:two: To run the app, you need to type `npm run dev` but here we use `dev` because this app is still in development state.
```
npm run dev
```

**your first dapp is now opened.** :100:
